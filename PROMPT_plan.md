0a. Study all files in `specs/` to learn the application specifications.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0c. Study `lib/facility_grid/` to understand domains, resources, and relationships.
0d. For reference, the application source code is in `lib/*`.

1. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present; it may be incorrect) and study existing source code in `lib/*`, `config/*`, and `test/*` and compare it against `specs/*`. Analyze findings, prioritize tasks, and create/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a bullet point list sorted in priority of items yet to be implemented. Think deeply. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations, placeholders, skipped/flaky tests, and inconsistent patterns. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to determine starting point for research and keep it up to date with items considered complete/incomplete.

IMPORTANT: Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first. Treat `lib/facility_grid` as the project's domain model — all Ash resources live there. `lib/facility_grid_web` contains the Phoenix web layer.

ULTIMATE GOAL: Build a working Phoenix LiveView application backed by Ash Framework that models the FacilityGrid facility management platform. The app should compile clean, have a PostgreSQL-backed data layer with correct migrations, JSON:API endpoints for core resources, authentication via AshAuthentication, and a LiveView UI for managing projects, equipment, tasks, issues, and tests. Consider missing elements and plan accordingly. If an element is missing, search first to confirm it doesn't exist, then if needed author the specification at specs/FILENAME.md. If you create a new element then document the plan to implement it in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.
